# BirbOS-packages
A package repository for the [BirbOS](https://github.com/birb-linux/birbos) Linux distribution

Big portion of the packages are based on [LFS](https://linuxfromscratch.org/~thomas/multilib/index.html) and [BLFS](https://linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/stable/) with some modifications to make them fit the packaging scheme. Also some of the patches provided by the LFS books are hosted in this git repo as a mirror, since the books don't seem to keep the patches around for old versions of the packages.

> **Warning**
> Since BirbOS is an independent distro with a singular core maintainer, don't expect this repository to be kept up-to-date. **There might be major security holes for quite a while before that is noticed and fixed.**
